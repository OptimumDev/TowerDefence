# TowerDefence

Python Human vs Orc Tower Defence Game

Using PyQt5 for GUI  
All pictures are drawn by me  

Made for University course, this project was started as my first python coding experience on 1st year of education   
It has awful architecture and poorly optimized, a lot of places lack usage of algorithms and external librarys, 
but I think that it's quite good for the first project) At least it's possible to play and quite interesting for some time

I had some plans to continue:
 - Different kinds of enemys with armour effects
 - Differnet kinds of towers with speed, range and damage modifiers
 - Different paths and route forks for enemy moving
 - Records table, customized skins
  
But soon stoped working on this project
